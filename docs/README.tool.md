# Using Tool

All functions in ROSCH need a configuration file wrote by YAML.
Tool creates stationery files in any format, automatically.
`$(TOPDIR)` represents your top working directory.
## 1. How to Install

```sh
$ cd $(TOPDIR)/Tool
$ make
``` 

## 2. How to use

```sh
$ cd $(TOPDIR)/Tool/bin
$ ./Tool (a GUI application is launched)
``` 

After that follow the instractions in the GUI application.

__Note__: Created files is a "stationery" file.
Please change some value initialized 0.
